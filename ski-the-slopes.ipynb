    "\n",
    "Each of you will complete two runs down the mountain, and the times of your runs will be added together. Whoever skis in the least overall time is the winner. Also, this being the Riddler Ski Federation, you have been presented detailed data on both you and your opponent. You are evenly matched, and both have the same [normal](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/NormalDistribution.html) probability distribution of finishing times for each run. And for both of you, your time on the first run is completely independent of your time on the second run.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first runs, your opponent goes first. Then, it’s your turn. As you cross the finish line, your coach excitedly signals to you that you were faster than your opponent. Without knowing either exact time, what’s the probability that you will still be ahead after the second run and earn your gold medal?"
